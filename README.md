# 📝 Blogging Application Backend (Node.js)

This is a **Node.js-based blogging backend application** created for learning and practice purposes. It covers several essential backend development concepts and best practices to build a scalable and modular web application.

## 🚀 Features

- User authentication using **JWT**
- Structured using **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture
- Built with **Object-Oriented Programming** principles
- Organized and maintainable **file structure**
- **Mongoose** for MongoDB data modeling
- **Multiple references** between collections (e.g., user-post, post-comment)

## 🧠 Covered Topics

1. **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure user authentication
2. **MVC Architecture** to separate concerns
3. **OOPS** concepts in designing models and services
4. **File structure** best practices for scalability
5. **Mongoose** for ODM (Object Data Modeling)
6. **Multiple Reference Handling** in MongoDB (relations like author → posts, post → comments)


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT for authentication

## 📚 Purpose

This project was built to understand and implement core backend development principles while working on a practical and real-world-like blogging platform.
